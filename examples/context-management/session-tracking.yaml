  description: |
    Track decisions, file changes, and findings during development sessions.
    Creates a persistent audit trail that survives context switches, enables
    handoffs between developers or AI agents, and supports post-session
    documentation generation.
  trigger: |
    - Starting any work session expected to last >30 minutes
    - Beginning feature implementation, debugging, or code review
    - When decisions need to be captured for future reference
    - Before context-switching to preserve current state
  examples:
    - "session start 'feat-user-auth'"
    - "session note 'Decision: Using JWT because mobile clients need stateless auth'"
    - "session file src/auth/jwt.go tests/auth_test.go"
    - "session export --format markdown > session-summary.md"

requires:
  sources_of_truth:
    - name: Session tracking tool
      location: CLI tool or IDE extension
      freshness: static
      validation: "session --version"
    - name: Session storage
      location: Local database, file system, or cloud service
      freshness: real-time
      validation: "session list" returns results

  access:
    - Write access to session storage
    - Read access to tracked files (for file association)

  dependencies: []

  environment:
    - Session tracking CLI or IDE extension installed
    - Storage backend configured (SQLite, PostgreSQL, cloud service)

  context:
    - Session naming convention for organization
    - Project or workspace context

produces:
  outputs:
    - format: Markdown
      destination: stdout or file via export
      consumers:
        - PR descriptions
        - Handoff documentation
        - Sprint retrospectives
        - Future debugging context
    - format: Structured data (JSON/YAML)
      destination: Session storage
      consumers:
        - Session search and filtering
        - Cross-session analysis
        - Agent context loading

  side_effects:
    - Creates session records in storage
    - Updates active session state

confidence:
  maturity: stable
  known_gaps:
    - File tracking is typically manual (no automatic git hook integration)
    - Session boundaries are developer-defined (no automatic timeout)
    - Cross-machine session access requires shared storage
    - No automatic association with tickets/issues
  failure_modes:
    - Forgetting to start session loses context audit trail
    - Storage unavailable causes command failures
    - Session name collision overwrites previous sessions (in some tools)
    - Export without active session returns empty output
