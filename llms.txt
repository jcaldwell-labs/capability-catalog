# Capability Catalog

> Schema and framework for documenting grounded, composable agent capabilities

## Overview

Capability Catalog addresses the gap between what AI agents claim they can do and what they can actually do in a given context. Skills describe knowledge; capabilities describe grounded, validated abilities with explicit requirements and limitations.

## Core Concept

capability = skill + environment context + truth dependencies

## Key Features

- Pre-flight validation before capability execution
- Explicit requirements (sources of truth, access, dependencies)
- Documented known gaps and failure modes
- Composable capability dependencies
- Maturity levels (experimental, developing, stable, battle-tested)

## Schema Structure

Each capability entry includes:
- action: What it does and when to trigger
- requires: Sources of truth, access, dependencies, environment, context
- produces: Outputs and side effects
- confidence: Maturity level, known gaps, failure modes
- metadata: Author, dates, tags

## Tools

- scripts/preflight.py: Check capability requirements before execution
- scripts/validate.py: Validate YAML files against schema

## Primary Use Cases

1. Agent self-assessment before claiming capabilities
2. Onboarding documentation showing actual tooling availability
3. Incident response knowing which tools work where
4. Context switch safety after environment changes

## Repository Structure

- capabilities/: User capability definitions
- examples/: Example capability files
- schema/: Capability schema definition
- scripts/: Validation and pre-flight tools
- docs/: Guides (authoring, integration, schema reference)
- essays/: Conceptual essays on agent reliability

## Getting Started

1. Clone: git clone https://github.com/jcaldwell-labs/capability-catalog.git
2. Pre-flight check: python scripts/preflight.py examples/observability/log-query.yaml
3. Validate: python scripts/validate.py examples/
4. Write capability: Create YAML file following schema
